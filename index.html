In addition, as part of an integrated team of MNH professionals (including, in alphabetical order, anaesthetists, doctors [such as obstetricians and paediatricians], midwives and nurses), they perform all signal functions of emergency maternal and newborn care to optimize the health and well-being of women and newborns.* Within an enabling environment, midwives educated and regulated to International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) standards can provide nearly all of the essential care needed for women and newborns.

Availability is defined in terms of the reachability (physical access), affordability (economic access) and acceptability (sociocultural access) of services that meet a minimum standard of quality. Making services available, affordable and acceptable is an essential precondition for achieving universal access. Coverage is defined as the proportion of people needing an intervention who receive it. Coverage is influenced by the supply or provision of services, and by the demand from those who need services and their health-seeking behaviour. Outcome and impact are defined in terms of medium-term effects, such as behavioural change or higher survival rates, and long-term effects, such as lower infection rates. Outcome and impact are the result of coverage, and depend on the efficiency and effectiveness of interventions.</td>
